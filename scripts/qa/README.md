# Browser sanity

Run from the repository root with the existing Playwright/Chrome QA runtime:

```sh
node scripts/qa/live-sanity.mjs
node scripts/qa/production-sanity.mjs
```

The first script requires the Vite development server and checks review/normal
starts, firing, keyboard/touch input, pause and Retry. The second requires a
current `npm run build` and opens a temporary local preview for production start
guards. Neither deploys or changes shipping code. Both fail on browser errors.

An optional first argument sets the output directory (default `artifacts/sanity`).
`TOPWAR_QA_URL` overrides the development URL. `TOPWAR_PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` may
point to another installed Playwright module URL, and `TOPWAR_CHROME_PATH` to
another Chrome executable; defaults use the existing local QA runtime.
Historical phase-specific capture/baseline scripts remain in Git history.
